# My First Blog Post

**Published on August 4, 2025**

This is my very first blog post! It took me some time to actually understand how to add this section to the site and how to make the entries easier for me on the future, stuff *can be broken* but eh, is good enough for documenting my work, discoveries or just random thoughts.


## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing different stuff that crosses across my mind, but not excluding:

*   My works or experiments in this journey on the fields of AI, coding, Singing Voice Synthesis, you know, the stuff.
*   Tutorials/Guides/Timelines of my work, discoveries, experiments.
*   My thoughts on several topics, not excluding non-tech topics.
*   Just random posts when I am bored.


> Bye.
